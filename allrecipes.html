    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Overview</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		The purpose of this usability study is to provide the Allrecipes.com team with a better understanding of how Allrecipes.com users are interacting with the content on the website. In order to gain a better understanding of how users are engaging with Allrecipes.com, we specifically observed how users responded to the new design on the Vegetarian page, and the user’s overall ability to find specific recipes. By investigating the user’s ability to complete these tasks, we were able to provide the Allrecipes.com team with information that will prove valuable in maximizing user engagement in the future.
	  </p>
	  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Problem Statement</b></h3>
	  <p class="w3-justify">
	  While there have previously been few problems regarding the functionality of Allrecipes.com reported to the site team, closely examining the user’s ability to complete important tasks on the website is essential to maximizing user engagement in the future. As a result, focusing our attention on the way in which the user responds to completing key tasks including finding specific recipes allowed us to gain an increased understanding of how the website is catering to the needs of the user.
	  </p>
	
	  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Goal</b></h3>
	  <p class="w3-justify">
		The goal of this usability test was to gain an understanding of how representative users utilize Allrecipes.com to navigate for recipes. In doing so, we intended to make concrete design recommendations that would allow for website improvement in the future.

    <p class="w3-justify">
		Each of our participants was recruited via a web-generated screener that we distributed on websites including Craigslist, Nextdoor, and UW Social Media Pages. Participants were expected to be the primary cooks within their household and actively use the Allrecipes.com website to prepare meals for their family members at least 1 days a week.
	  </p>
	 
	 <p class="w3-justify">
	 From our survey, we were able to recruit five users of Allrecipes.com to participate in our usability test.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Study Procedure</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
	We began by recruiting five Allrecipes.com users who serve as the primary cooks within their household. We then then invited each user to a testing room in the Snoqualmie Library Building on the University of Washington Tacoma campus to participate in a usability study on Allrecipes.com that would last between 30 and 60 minutes. Upon arrival, each participant was asked to sign a contract giving our team the jurisdiction to record our usability session using Lookback. Participants were then given a pretest questionnaire that asked them to fill out information on their previous experience with Allrecipes.com, including how often they access the website, what they use the website for, and what other sites they use to find recipes.
	  </p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
	Each participant was given 11 scenarios that asked them to complete tasks on the website including finding specific recipes, using the community forum, and locating information on the Allrecipes magazine. After each user completed each task, the participant was then asked a post-test question that allowed them to rate their ease of executing the task on a scale from 1-5 where 1 was very easy and 5 was very difficult.
	</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
	Once users had completed the 11 assigned tasks, each user was given a System Usability Scale (SUS) survey which allowed the participant to rate the website in terms of its design and functionality. Following completion of the SUS, users were then asked to complete a debriefing questionnaire that allowed us to gain a better understanding of the users’ overall feelings about their experience using the website. 
	
	</p>
  </div>
	
<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Developing Scenarios</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		I read each participant a series of 11 scenarios that asked them to complete a given task on the Allrecipes.com website. Among these 11 tasks, users were asked to complete tasks including:
		<ul class="w3-justify">
		<li>Finding recipes that included or excluded specific ingredients</li>
		<li>Using the community forum to ask questions to Allrecipes.com users</li>
		<li>Locating additional information on the Allrecipes magazine </li>
		</ul>
	  </p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
	In giving users these tasks, we aimed to gain a better understanding of how users were able to navigate the website using the “Include and Exclude Ingredient” function of the search bar, locate recipes using the categories in the Browse Menu, interact with the content on the community forum, and find information on the Allrecipes magazine.
	</p>
  </div>
	
<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Success and Failure Metrics</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		When asked to find a specific recipe, the team deemed user success based on the participant’s ability to find the required recipe without using the generic search bar to complete the task. If the user went straight to the search bar to find the recipe, the user was asked to find a recipe that would meet the task requirements in an alternative way (i.e. using the “Include and Exclude Ingredient” function of the search bar, or using the Browse Menu). Failed task rates were used to define the participant’s inability to find the recipe in an alternative way.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Task Successes</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		The five Allrecipes.com users were generally able to navigate the Allrecipes.com website well and use the site effectively. When each participant was asked to execute a task, the users frequently commented on the visually appealing nature of the website, reiterating why they use Allrecipes.com in their daily lives.
	  </p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
		Some of the positive comments stated by the five study participants included:
	<ul class="w3-justify">
	<li>“I like that, it looks like Pinterest”</li>
	<li>“I love the pictures and videos. Everything looks so good!”</li>
	<li>“[Allrecipes.com] is  great! I’ll come back and find a dinner recipe tonight”</li>
	<li>“This [recipe] looks freaking delicious!”</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
		All five users preferred to use the generic search bar to find a specific recipe. In the debriefing questionnaire, most users stated that the search bar was their favorite aspect of the website because it allowed them to effectively navigate through the website content quickly.

<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Task Struggles</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		While all five users were consistently successful in navigating the website using the general search bar, users often struggled to find specific recipes in alternative ways. When asked to locate a recipe without using the search bar, users who used the browse menu found it difficult to narrow their search to find a recipe that met the task requirements.
	</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
	Comments from users who attempted to use the browse menu to find a recipe included:
		<ul class="w3-justify">
			<li>“I would just go somewhere else”</li>
			<li>“Does it have to be on this site?”</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
	Users also struggled to use the “Include and Exclude Ingredient” function of the search bar to narrow their search results.
    Comments from users who attempted to use the “Include and Exclude Ingredient” function of the search bar included:
		<ul class="w3-justify">
		<li>“Can I just use Google?”</li>
		<li>“I’d be looking all day”</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
  </div>

<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Specific Task Struggles</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		Users consistently struggled to complete tasks 4 and 7. Both of these tasks asked the user to find a specific recipe without using the generic search bar on the website. In both of these situations, users struggled to use both the “Include and Exclude Ingredient” function of the toolbar as well as the Browse Menu to locate the recipe they were looking for.
	</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
	Task number 4 asked users to find a flourless cookie recipe on the Allrecipes.com website. This task was the most difficult task for the five participants to execute. For this task, all five users initially went immediately to the general search bar to find the intended recipe. When the users execute the task in this way, all five users were able to successfully find a recipe that met the task requirements and looked appealing to them. However, when the five users were asked to find a flourless cookie recipe in another way, users encounter some struggle. Three of the five users attempted to use the “Include and Exclude Ingredient” function of the search bar to find the recipe they were looking for. However, when the three users used this function to narrow their search typing “cookies” in the search bar and “flour” in the “Exclude” section, all three users were unable to successfully find the recipe they were looking for because all of the recipes generated for them still contained flour. Additionally, one user stated that there was no alternative way to find the recipe. Only one participant successfully completed this task in an alternative way, making use of the Browse Menu to narrow their search to find a cookie recipe that did not require flour.

    </div>
	</p>
<br><br>
<p class="w3-justify">
In addition, three of the five users were unable to successfully complete task seven. Task seven asked the participant to find a recipe for pancakes that did not require milk. Similarly to task four, users struggled to find a lactose-free pancake recipe without making use of the search bar. Users who attempted to narrow their search using the categories in the Browse Menu struggled to find a clear and logical path that would allow them to find the recipe for pancakes successfully.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Data</b></h3>
    <h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Task vs. Time of Completion</b></h4><br><br>

		<p class="w3-justify">
		This data represents the average length of time it took for each participant to finish 11 tasks. The red categorizes tasks that took users the longest amount of time. For instance, task 2 involved locating a ham and cheese recipe and finding a dairy-free recipe for task 7. Users were able to complete the last 4 tasks in the quickest amount of time which may correlate back to them gaining comfortability in navigating the website over time.

	<h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Post-Task Difficulty Ratings</b></h4><br><br>

		<img src="difficulty.png" alt="Post-Task difficulty chart and graph" style="width:100%">
  
    </div>
	<br><br>
<p class="w3-justify">
	After each participant completed a task, we asked them to rate their ease of execution on a scale from 1-5 (1 being easy, 5 being difficult). Figures 2a and 2b represent the average rating of our participants. We can see that users consistently found the tasks straightforward to complete, rating no task on average higher than a 2.6. This demonstrates that users found the tasks relatively easy to complete overall.

	<h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>System Usability Scale (SUS) Scores</b></h4><br><br>

		<img src="SUS.png" alt="Chart of SUS scores" style="width:100%">
  
    </div>
	<br><br>
<p class="w3-justify">
	Following the completion of all 11 tasks, each user was asked to complete a System Usability Scale questionnaire asking them to rate the website regarding its functionality from strongly disagree to strongly agree. An average System Usability Scale score is 68, but for our study the average came back as 77. This means that the site was generally used well and was above average in performability.

	<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Recommendations</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		When users were asked to find a specific recipe that included or excluded certain ingredients, few participants made use of the “Include” and “Exclude” function of the search bar. Taking this into consideration, making this search option more visible in the future may improve users’ ability to find the recipes that they are looking for.
	  </p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
		Users also rarely spent time searching through the browse menu on the website to find specific recipes. Instead, participants often depended on the search bar to find the recipes they were looking for. In order to keep users on the website for even one more click, revising the design of the browse menu to make it easier for users to search through may prove to be fundamental in maximizing user engagement with Allrecipes.com in the future.
		</p>
		
	<p class="w3-justify">
		In order to maximize user engagement in the future, it is essential that additional usability studies are conducted on the website to gain a better understanding of how users are able to effectively use the website. Being that we conducted our usability study on users of Allrecipes.com whose ages varied from 18-59 years of age, honing in on a specific age group in future studies may provide vital information on how users are interacting with the content on the website.
