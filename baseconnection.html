	<h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Designing a Messaging Application for Military Spouses</b></h2>
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Overview</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		This low-fidelity prototype illustrates an original messaging application that would be used by military spouses to form local connections with one another.
	  </p>
	  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Problem Statement</b></h3>
	  <p class="w3-justify">
	Military spouses are faced with the looming possibility of relocating to another state spaced far away from their family members and close friends at any time. With the burden of moving comes the hardship of forming connections with other like-minded people, finding new job options, and feeling safe and secure in an unfamiliar location.
<br><br>
	  Currently, there are limited mobile phone applications that adequately support military spouse networks throughout the world.  Websites like the National Military Spouse Network provide very limited resources that would benefit a spouse and their family. BaseConnection would fill this gap and ensure spouses have access to pertinent information to meet their goals. 
	  </p>
	  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Design Question</b></h3>
	  <p class="w3-justify"> 
	  How might we design a messaging application for military spouses that is safe and customizable for users?
	  </p>
	  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Design Goal</b></h3>
	  <p class="w3-justify">
	  Our team intended to create a safe and inclusive online community that would allow military spouses to form meaningful relationships with one another.
	  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Software Used</b></h3>
	  <p class="w3-justify">
	  Balsamiq
	  </p>
	  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>My Roles</b></h3>
	  <p class="w3-justify left">
	  <ul style="text-align:left;">
	  <li>Project Manager</li>
	  <li>Facilitator for contextual inquiries</li>
	  <li>Designer of low-fi prototypes in Balsamiq</li>
	  </ul>

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Contextual Inquiries</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		To understand the problem space, our team performed three contextual inquiries with representative users. Each user was a current military spouse living in the Pacific Northwest, ranging in age from 25-35. I conducted our contextual inquiries in each of our user's homes to better understand the context that military spouses would be accessing BaseConnection in.
		<br><br>
		During our contextual inquiries, we found that:
		<ul class="w3-justify">
	 	<li>Users have very little time to dedicates to themselves</li>
	 	<li>Users are unable to participate in the activities they enjoy because of time and money limitations</li>
		<li>Users are interested in interacting with others on a platform they trust is safe</li>
	 </ul>
	  </p>
		<p class="w3-justify">
		The military spouses we interviewed also shared that they currently use mobile applications like Facebook to get in touch with other military spouses near them. While this allows them to better connect with military spouses who are stationed in the same area as them, they shared that it is difficult to find the information they need on the public boards. As a result, they often find themselves taking extended breaks from socializing online because of their busy schedules.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Affinity Diagramming</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		After our team performed our three contextual inquiries, we began affinity diagramming to identify key user needs. When identifying what users were looking for in "we" statements, we found that users wanted to engage with one another on a platform that would:
		<ul class="w3-justify">
		<li>Allow them to form connections centered around mutual interests</li>
		<li>Ensure their privacy needs were maintained</li>
		<li>Honor their unique time constraints and busy lives</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
	As a result, it was important that our team took into consideration how we could create an engaging social application that military spouses would feel is safe and inclusive.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Prototyping</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		Once our team understood the problem space, we were able to begin developing our mobile application. We began by creating a series of wireframes that outlined the possible screens that would characterize the application. Because users wanted to use a mobile application that was safe and secure, we created a user sign up page where users would be asked to share a picture of their military ID so that they could be verified by local administrators. Users would then be able to select their interests so they could connect with military spouses who enjoyed similar hobbies to them.
	  </p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
		After creating our wireframes, we created a low-fidelity prototype of our screens in Balsamiq. These screens would allow users to create an account, select their military base, follow boards centered around their unique interests, connect with other users on a public messaging board, and exchange personal details in private messages.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Usability Testing</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		To gain a better understanding of how use BaseConnection to meet their needs, our team tested our low-fi prototypes with three representative users. We printed out our 11 screens and asked users to complete tasks including:
		<ul class="w3-justify">
		<li>You are interested in connecting with other military spouses who are interested in the oudoors. How would you connect with others in your community?</li>
		<li>You and your spouse recently relocated from Joint Base Lewis McChord to Shepphard Air Force Base. How would you make sure you are connected with people near to you?</li>
		<li>You want to connect with a military spouse who shares your interest in hiking, but you don't want to publicly share your phone number. How do you go about connecting?</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="w3-container">
 
		<img src="baseconnectionhome.jpg" alt="User interacting with interests page" style="width:65%">
  
    </div>
	<p class="w3-justify">
	When we asked users to complete these tasks, they struggled to find categories that were relevant to their interests. Because the interest options we offered were limited, users with diverse interests found it difficult to find categories that resonnated with them. Additionally, users encountered struggle when finding a way to change their location. While users could find the page, they still wanted to be able to connect with users at the previous base for chatting purposes.
	  </p>
	</p>
  </div>

<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Findings and Next Steps</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		In preparation for the next iteration of BaseConnection, our team would like to incorporate the feedback we gained on our design during peer review. One of the participants who tested our initial design noticed that it was difficult to locate the interest items they were looking for because of the organization of the icons. Acknowledging this issue, we would like to regroup like-interests together based on relevant categories.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		Our team would also like to continue developing interest categories that would better fit user needs. Because BaseConnection only supports nine interests at the moment, expanding on these interest categories could better serve users' diverse needs in the future.
		<br>
		<br>
		During this project, we focused our attention on how BaseConnection could best serve military spouses living in the Pacific Northwest. To better meet the needs of diverse military spouses across the world, we would be interested to research cross-cultural implications for military families stationed overseas.
