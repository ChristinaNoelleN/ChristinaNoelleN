	<h2 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Using Data to Inform the Design of a Social Robot</b></h2>
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Overview</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		After working with teens in local high schools for several months, our team analyzed our findings from the Social Robot Design Challenge to inform the design of EMAR moving forward. 
	  </p>
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Problem Statement</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		Teens are underrepresented in UX design, yet teens have unique needs. Teens are also statistically more stressed than any other age group. In better understanding the features teens would want in a social robot that would measure teen stress, we can design a robot that would best meet their needs.
	  </p>
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Design Question</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		How might we design a social robot to meet the diverse needs of students at different high schools?
	  </p>
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Method</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		In order to inform the design of EMAR moving forward, our team began by transcribing videos taken at the Social Robot Design Challenge. Each of these videos ranged from 10 to 15 minutes in length and featured students from the six high schools we worked with speaking about their strategic design choices.
		<br><br>
		Once these videos were coded, we transferred them to Saturate App so we could code the videos and identify key thematic ideas. From these data transcriptions, our team gained insight into common features teens are looking for in a social robot that would measure teen stress.
	  </p>
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>My Roles</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		<ul style="text-align:left;">
			<li>Transcribing videos</li>
			<li>Coding videos in Saturate</li>
			<li>Writing recommendations to design team</li>
		</ul>

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Transcribing Videos</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		At the Social Robot Design Challenge, our team took videos of each team describing the features their social robot would have. Students explained their design decisions and how they used the human centered design process to create their prototype. Our team began by transcribing the video data using Saturate. Once the transcriptions were completed, we were able to begin identifying key emerging themes and features that students wanted to see in a social robot.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Coding Transcriptions</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		After transcribing the videos, I began coding the video transcriptions from Henry Foss High School and Roosevelt High School. As I was coding, I began to notice the following key themes emerging in the data:
		<ul class="w3-justify">
	 	<li><b>Voice:</b> students envisioned their social robots speaking to stressed teens in voices they found soothing</li>
		<li><b>Gender:</b> students used different pronouns to refer to EMAR</li>
		<li><b>Gift giving/reciprocity:</b>in exchange for sharing their stress levels, students wanted to receive a hug or a food-related item</li>
	 	</ul>
	</p>
  </div>
	
<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Looking Deeper at Codes</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
	After noticing the emerging themes of gender, reciprocity, and voice, our team began looking for reasons behind these features.
		</p>
	<h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Gender</b></h4>
	<p class="w3-justify">
 		Most of the students referred to their robot using gender neutral pronouns like “it.” However, students at Ballard High School referred to their puppy-looking social robot prototype using the gendered pronoun “she.” When prompted about the usage of pronouns by the judges, the students shared that they misspoke and EMAR should be gender-neutral to appeal to a broader audience. Looking deeper into the role that gender plays in human-robot interaction is important as we move forward with our design of EMAR.

	</p>
	<h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Gift Giving and Reciprocity</b></h4>
	<p class="w3-justify">
	The designs showed that teens expect robots to help them and give them things in ways that we classified as active, passive, and material ways. Examples of active giving classified behaviors that were designed for the robot to show affection to the user or to make the user laugh. For example, students at Henry Foss High School designed their social robot prototype Boom-Boom with slinky arms that could shake the hands of stressed teens, while other robots including Roosevelt High School’s Joaquin Bartholomew III featured the ability to hug the user.

	</p>
	<h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Voice</b></h4>
	<p class="w3-justify">
	Voice also played a role in the way the students envisioned their social robots interacting with stressed teens. For example, students at Roosevelt High School considered the accent that their robot Joaquin Bartholomew III would have when speaking to teens. Students at the Science and Math Institute (SAMI) also considered the role of voice when designing their robot Carlbot, allowing Carlbot’s voice to be customizable and mimic the voices of students’ favorite celebrities.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Sharing our Findings with the Public</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		After recognizing common themes in the data, our team was able to recognize how we could move forward and produce a new design that would meet the needs of teens. Our team presented a lightning talk at UW Tacoma to share our findings and process with the public.

	</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
		We also created a video that we shared with the local high schools we worked with. This video details what our team gained from the qualitative data analysis process after working with teens to design social robot prototypes.

    <p class="w3-justify">
		Our team is still impressed by the unique designs that were created by the students we worked with. To better inform our designs in the future, we will spend the 2019 academic year working with teens in local high schools to receive feedback on our own design. Our goals are:
		<ul class="w3-justify">
		<li>To gain a better understanding of students' responses to social robot movement</li>
		<li>To gain insight into how EMAR can form a meaningful first interaction with students</li>
		<li>To better inform the navigation interface that will be featured on EMAR's tablet screens</li>
		</ul>
