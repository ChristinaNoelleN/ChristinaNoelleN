    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Overview</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		The Project EMAR team worked with teens in six high schools in the Pacific Northwest to design social robot prototypes. Teens shared these designs at our Social Robot Design Challenge in Seattle. Our team used the findings from the Social Robot Design Challenge to inform the design of our own social robot, EMAR.
	  </p>
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Problem Statement</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		Teens are underrepresented in UX design, yet teens have unique needs. Teens are also statistically more stressed than any other age group. 
	</p>
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Design Question</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		How might teens design a social robot prototype that would live in their school?
	  </p>
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:left;"><b>Method</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		Our team used participatory design strategies to engage teens in the design process. In our Social Robot Design Challenge, six local area high schools constructed original social robot prototypes that were inspired by the needs of students at their own schools. We then had students present their prototypes to a team of judges at the Social Robot Design Challenge. The prototypes created by the students will help inform the design of our social robot in the future.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Research</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		When our team first entered Henry Foss IB World School, we noticed that it was the first time many students had ever heard of the term "social robot." To get teens started thinking about how they would design a social robot prototype that would live in their school, we asked them to begin by researching existing social robots online. Students discovered social robots including Jibo, NAO, and Pepper They noticed that social robots took many different forms, including animals and humanoids.
		<br><br>
		Once the students had gained an understanding of existing social robots, we asked them to interview their peers to uncover what stressed them out, what helped them relieve their stress, and how they work to cope with stress in their daily lives. The teens interviewed one another in pairs for 10 minutes before switching roles.
		<br><br>
		During the interviews, students uncovered that their peers were often stressed by the pressure they felt from their parents and teachers. Students were also stressed out by tests and school-related expectations, including having the fear of failing a difficult chemistry test or receiving a low SAT score. To relieve their stress, students shared that they turn to music by their favorite artists to comfort them. They also shared that they find it stress relieving when someone who they care about gives them a gift like a candy bar or words of encouragement.

 <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px">
    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Ideation</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		Once the students understood what stressed their peers out and what helped them feel better, we handed them stacks of sticky notes. Students then wrote down what features they wanted their social robot to have based on the findings they gained from interviewing their peers.
		<br><br>
		After the students had their ideas written down, they sorted their sticky notes into categories based on similar features. Students uncovered important features like the need for a social robot to play music, offer gifts, and help students complete daily tasks. The students soon had a long list of common features that they wanted their robots to display.
		<br><br>
		Once the students had an understanding of what features their robots needed to have to help their peers, they began sketching their ideas out on paper. During this time, robots took shape as boxy figures, hovercrafts, and soft cuddly animals. The students annotated their drawings and explained how long arms would be used for hugging, soft bodides would be indestructible in the busy hallways, and hovercrafts would allow their robots to travel anywhere in the school quickly.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Prototyping</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		With their sketches in hand, the students jumped into teams of four and began prototyping their social robots using cardboard, pool noodles, and googly eyes. The student's used their initial sketches as a reference, and the ideas that once existed in their heads soon became tangible creations.

	<p class="w3-justify">Over the course of several days, the students perfected their prototypes with hot glue and tape. The students wanted their prototypes to be durable enough to withstand the busy hallways at Foss, and they needed their prototypes to handle the bus ride to Seattle. <br><br>

<p class="w3-justify">
	At the end of the week, the students had created six unique prototypes that ranged in size and shape. While each of these social robots looked very different, they all intended to help address teen stress through empathy.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Testing</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		Once the students had finalized their prototypes, we invited six students from another class to test their designs. The students used the Wizard-of-Oz method to demonstrate how their social robot would interact with students to help them to reduce their stress while the other students took notes about the participantâ€™s comments, feedback, and areas of struggle.

		<img src="reminder.jpg" alt="A reminder on testing" style="width:100%">
  
    </div>
	</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
When the students were testing the prototypes, they noticed areas for improvement. These areas included:
	<ul class="w3-justify">
		<li><b>Designing for destructability</b>: Some of the robots would fall apart if you touched them, so their fragility would make them vulnerable to breaking in the busy hallways</li>
		<li><b>Thinking about size</b>: Several prototypes were so tall that it they lost their "cute factor," while others were so small that it was hard to talk to them</li>
		<li><b>Considering tone of voice:</b> Several teams had forgotten what their social robot would sound like</li>

	</ul>
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">
		<br><br>
		Uncovering the needs of representative users allowed each team to see where they could improve their designs moving forward. After usability testing with the others teens, each team revisited their findings to understand how their prototypes could be adjusted to better meet the needs of their peers in the future.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Iteration</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		Taking the findings gained from usability testing with their peers, the students then reworked their designs to help their prototypes better fit the needs of their users. The teens took hot glue guns and repositioned arms, rethought the sizes of their designs, and reworked their creations to prepare them for the final showcase in Seattle.

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16" style="text-align:center;"><b>Presenting at the Showcase</b></h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
		The students nominated one team to share their design at the showcase in Seattle. The elected robot, Boom-Boom, was a social robot that would be able to help teens carry their books to class, give stressed teens their favorite candy bars when they were hungry, and tell funny jokes to make stressed teens laugh.
		<br><br>
		The teens were then able to explore the five other creations presented by teens at other schools including Carlbot, Petunia, the Relaxation Room, Joaquin Bartholomew III, and Lucy. The students were impressed by how different each of their creations was, but how they implemented similar features including gift giving.

    <p class="w3-justify">
		While we were at the Social Robot Design Challenge, our team took videos of each student team presenting their ideas to the public. We will be moving forawrd by taking these videos and coding them for common themes so that we can better inform the design of EMAR.
